# contactApp

Simple contact app SPA in using angular JS to demonstrate the usability
of MVC at the front end.I have used simplified MVC architecture and 
separate the view from the controller to model and understand easily.

Note:The data in service in static for the demo purpose, but i can easily
modify the code and by implementing $http in services to use the live data
from the API.

Thanks
